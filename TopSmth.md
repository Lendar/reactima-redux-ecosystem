###TopSmth screening process
* Round #1: Skype ... English & staff
* Round #2: 
```Online coding exercise on codility.com. This one is quite tough, they gave me three tasks with increasing complexity to solve in 90 minutes. All the tasks are *real* programming riddles. You have to choose good data structures, develop intelligent algorithms, and even meet a run time constraint (which is given in Big-O-Notation). However, they explicitly state that it is better to complete two tasks correctly than to complete all three somewhat correct. I therefore opted for making the first two *perfect* with good test case coverage and see about the last task afterwards. I completed the first exercise in 15 minutes and the second one in 60 minutes. Finally, 15 minutes was definitely too short for completing task three, so I just wrote a comment about my solution strategy. (After the test, I almost programmed the solution for task three, because it was actually a very interesting problem…). Feedback came back a few days later by my interviewer as “very good”. I solved task one and two perfectly and was scheduled for round three.

* Round #3: ```Life coding exercise. Two programming tasks are to be solved in a total of 60 minutes, but this time the interviewer was watching my progress live via Skype screen sharing. The interview started with a review of my solutions for round two. I also explained my solution strategy for task three. The first life coding exercise was a simple string manipulation task, however,  I did rather badly. I’m not used to do low level string processing in C# and my solution was correct, but unnecessarily complex. The second coding exercise was closer to a real life application, and I solved it fast and elegantly. The interviewer congratulated me and I was scheduled for round four.```

* Round #4: ```Real life project. After round three I was given two weeks of time to finish a real world project involving a database back-end, a RESTful API, and an AJAX front end. Experienced web developers would probably finish this project in a few hours, but I took the opportunity to learn more about web front ends, JavaScript libraries and ASP.net. I tested the different possible approaches in C# (WCF, ASP.net Web API + separate page, and ASP.net single page application with Web API) and finally decided to go for the single page application. I covered everything nicely with unit tests, created a solid data layout at the back end, and created a rather extensive AJAX front end using several JavaScript libraries.
```
* Review of Round #4: 
```The project is uploaded to toptal’s Git server. In addition there is the last Skype interview where I explained my solution in detail, answered questions, and proved that the RESTful API works using Fiddler. Finally the interviewer welcomed me at toptal and instructed me about the further administrative steps.```

* TODO coding ... 
```After passing the live coding session you get another assignment. This time you have to build a simple ToDo list app using Ajax, sign up, priorities with simple REST API. You can do this anytime you want, you just get access to Toptal’s gitlab where push the solution later. After that you schedule the presentation with a Toptal interviewer.```
