> In JavaScript, arrays and objects are passed by reference, so if you mutate array or object parameters, it doesnâ€™t just affect the variable inside the function. It also affects any other function that uses a reference to the same variable.

> The iterable protocol allows JavaScript objects to define or customize their iteration behavior, such as what values are looped over in a for..of construct. Some built-in types are built-in iterables with a default iteration behavior, such as Array or Map, while other types (such as Object) are not.
