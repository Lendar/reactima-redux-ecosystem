### Table of Contents
This is an attempt to recompile [Category Theory for Programmers: The Preface]() by [Bartosz Milewski](https://twitter.com/BartoszMilewski) in ES6.
Bartosz examples are heavily relied on [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) - statically typed purely-functional programming language for guys with Ph.D.
