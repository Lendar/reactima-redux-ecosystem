##Category Theory for ES6

### Table of Contents
This is an attempt to recompile thoughts and ideas from [Category Theory for Programmers]() by [Bartosz Milewski](https://twitter.com/BartoszMilewski) into ES6 examples.Bartosz Milewski work is great, however most of examples are heavily relied on [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) - statically typed purely-functional programming language for guys with Ph.D., but not for humans who needs quick results and under heavy pressure from business. 

Sub-goal is to find parallels with great [Ramda.js](http://ramdajs.com/) library.
```
Ramda distinguishing features are:
* Ramda emphasizes a purer functional style. 
  Immutability and side-effect free functions are at the heart of its design philosophy. 
* Ramda functions are automatically curried. 
* The parameters to Ramda functions are arranged to make it convenient for currying. 
  The data to be operated on is generally supplied last.
